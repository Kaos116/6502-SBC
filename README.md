# 6502-SBC
There is an error between the schematic and PCB that has a few work arounds.

* Problem *

The RAM chip called for in the schematic is physically wider than the foot print on the PCB

* Possible Fixes *

1. Change the PCB foot print to fit the wider IC
2. Use a UM61256 chip which would limit your RAM to 32K
3. Bend the leads of the wider memory chip to fit.
